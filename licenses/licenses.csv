harmony-reflect@1.6.1;harmony-reflect@1.6.1;1.6.1;harmony-reflect;37043;ES5 shim for ES6 (ECMAScript 6) Reflect and Proxy objects;git+https://tvcutsem@github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect;;;;(Apache-2.0 OR MPL-1.1);;/Users/clemensw/Projekte/VW/DPP/erfassungs-app/node_modules/harmony-reflect/README.md;[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/harmony-reflect.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/harmony-reflect) [![Dependencies](https://david-dm.org/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect.png)](https://david-dm.org/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect)  This is a shim for the ECMAScript 6 [Reflect](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-reflect-object) and [Proxy](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-proxy-objects) objects.  This library does two things:    - It defines an ES6-compliant `Reflect` global object that exports the ECMAScript 6 reflection API.   - If harmony-era (pre-ES6) `Proxy` support is available, it patches `Proxy` to be up-to-date with the [ES6 spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/).  **July 2016 update**: the most recent version of all major browsers and node.js now [support fully ES6-compliant](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/#test-Proxy) `Reflect` and `Proxy` objects. This shim is primarily useful if you want ES6 `Reflect` support on older browsers or versions of node.js < v6.0.0, or if you want ES6 `Proxy` support on versions of node.js < v6.0.0.  **May 2016 update**: the recently released [V8 v4.9](http://v8project.blogspot.com.au/2016/01/v8-release-49.html) includes native support for ES2015 Proxies and Reflect, making this library obsolete for environments that embed V8 4.9 or newer (like Chrome 49 and Node v6.0). Node v5.10.x or lower still requires this polyfill for proper ES6 Proxy support.  Read [Why should I use this library?](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/wiki)  Installation ============  For node.js, install via [npm](http://npmjs.org):      npm install harmony-reflect  Then:      node --harmony-proxies     > var Reflect = require('harmony-reflect');;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The BSD License is recommended for most projects. It is simple and easy to understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with the Forge project.  If the GPL suits your project better you are also free to use Forge under that license.  You don't have to do anything special to choose one license or the other and you don't have to notify anyone which license you are using. You are free to use this project in commercial projects as long as the copyright header is left intact.  If you are a commercial entity and use this set of libraries in your commercial software then reasonable payment to Digital Bazaar, if you can afford it, is not required but is expected and would be appreciated. If this library saves you time, then it's saving you money. The cost of developing the Forge software was on the order of several hundred hours and tens of thousands of dollars. We are attempting to strike a balance between helping the development community while not being taken advantage of by lucrative commercial entities for our efforts.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- New BSD License (3-clause) Copyright (c) 2010, Digital Bazaar, Inc.

Watchman provides file change notification services using very efficient recursive watches and also allows more advanced change matching and filesystem tree querying operations using [a powerful expression syntax](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/file-query.html#expressions).  ## Install  You should [install Watchman]( https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html) to make the most of this module.  Then simply:  ``` $ npm install fb-watchman ```  ## Key Concepts  - Watchman recursively watches directories. - Each watched directory is called a `root`. - You must initiate a `watch` on a `root` using the `watch-project` command prior to subscribing to changes - Rather than separately watching many sibling directories, `watch-project` consolidates and re-uses existing watches relative to a project root (the location of your `.watchmanconfig` or source control repository root) - change notifications are relative to the project root  ## How do I use it?

Distribution of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related information available on an 'as-is' basis. Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the fullest extent possible.  Using Creative Commons Public Licenses  Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.       Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are      intended for use by those authorized to give the public      permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by      copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are      irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms      and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.      Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before      applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the      material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any      material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-      licensed material, or material used under an exception or      limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors: 	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors       Considerations for the public: By using one of our public      licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the      licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If      the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for      example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to      copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our      licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain      other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of      the licensed material may still be restricted for other      reasons, including because others have copyright or other      rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,      such as asking that all changes be marked or described.      Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to      respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations      for the public:  	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensees  =======================================================================  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License  By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License ('Public License').

For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed      Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,      Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is      synched in timed relation with a moving image.    b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright      and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in      accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.    c.

For purposes of this Public License, the rights      specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar      Rights.    d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the      absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws      fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright      Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international      agreements.    e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or      any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights      that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.    f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,      or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public      License.    g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the      terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to      all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the      Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.    h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights      under this Public License.    i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or      process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such      as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,      dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material      available to the public including in ways that members of the      public may access the material from a place and at a time      individually chosen by them.    j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright      resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of      the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,      as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially      equivalent rights anywhere in the world.    k.

paho-mqtt@1.1.0;paho-mqtt@1.1.0;1.1.0;paho-mqtt;36526;Eclipse Paho JavaScript MQTT client for Browsers;https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.javascript;;;;EPL-1.0;;/Users/clemensw/Projekte/VW/DPP/erfassungs-app/node_modules/paho-mqtt/README.md;# Eclipse Paho JavaScript client  The Paho JavaScript Client is an MQTT browser-based client library written in Javascript that uses WebSockets to connect to an MQTT Broker.  ## Project description:  The Paho project has been created to provide reliable open-source implementations of open and standard messaging protocols aimed at new, existing, and emerging applications for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT). Paho reflects the inherent physical and cost constraints of device connectivity. Its objectives include effective levels of decoupling between devices and applications, designed to keep markets open and encourage the rapid growth of scalable Web and Enterprise middleware and applications.  ## Links  - Project Website: [https://www.eclipse.org/paho](https://www.eclipse.org/paho) - Eclipse Project Information: [https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.paho](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.paho) - Paho Javascript Client Page: [https://eclipse.org/paho/clients/js/](https://eclipse.org/paho/clients/js) - GitHub: [https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.javascript](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.javascript) - Twitter: [@eclipsepaho](https://twitter.com/eclipsepaho) - Issues: [github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.javascript/issues](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.javascript/issues) - Mailing-list: [https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/paho-dev](https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/paho-dev   ## Using the Paho Javascript Client   ### Downloading  A zip file containing the full and a minified version the Javascript client can be downloaded from the [Paho downloads page](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.paho/downloads)  Alternatively the Javascript client can be downloaded directly from the projects git repository: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.javascript/master/src/paho-mqtt.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.javascript/master/src/paho-mqtt.js).  Please **do not** link directly to this url from your application.  ### Building from source  There are two active branches on the Paho Java git repository, ```master``` which is used to produce stable releases, and ```develop``` where active development is carried out. By default cloning the git repository will download the ```master``` branch, to build from develop make sure you switch to the remote branch: ```git checkout -b develop remotes/origin/develop```  The project contains a maven based build that produces a minified version of the client, runs unit tests and generates it's documentation.  To run the build:  ``` $ mvn ```  The output of the build is copied to the ```target``` directory.  ### Tests  The client uses the [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) test framework. The tests for the client are in:  ``` src/tests ```  To run the tests with maven, use the following command: ``` $ mvn test ``` The parameters passed in should be modified to match the broker instance being tested against.  ### Documentation  Reference documentation is online at: [http://www.eclipse.org/paho/files/jsdoc/index.html](http://www.eclipse.org/paho/files/jsdoc/index.html)  ### Compatibility  The client should work in any browser fully supporting WebSockets, [http://caniuse.com/websockets](http://caniuse.com/websockets) lists browser compatibility.  ## Getting Started  The included code below is a very basic sample that connects to a server using WebSockets and subscribes to the topic ```World```, once subscribed, it then publishes the message ```Hello``` to that topic. Any messages that come into the subscribed topic will be printed to the Javascript console.  This requires the use of a broker that supports WebSockets natively, or the use of a gateway that can forward between WebSockets and TCP.  ```JS // Create a client instance client = new Paho.MQTT.Client(location.hostname, Number(location.port), 'clientId');;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

By having only a single instance of these functions around, it's possible to do some nice optimizations. Eg. [`CSSselect`](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.  ###And why is this a separate module?  I'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions. IMHO, having a separate module is the easiest solution to this problem.;no;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

saxes@5.0.1;saxes@5.0.1;5.0.1;saxes;5.0.1;An evented streaming XML parser in JavaScript;https://github.com/lddubeau/saxes;;;;ISC;;/Users/clemensw/Projekte/VW/DPP/erfassungs-app/node_modules/saxes/README.md;# saxes  A sax-style non-validating parser for XML.  Saxes is a fork of [sax](https://github.com/isaacs/sax-js) 1.2.4. All mentions of sax in this project's documentation are references to sax 1.2.4.  Designed with [node](http://nodejs.org/) in mind, but should work fine in the browser or other CommonJS implementations.  Saxes does not support Node versions older than 10.  ## Notable Differences from Sax.  * Saxes aims to be much stricter than sax with regards to XML   well-formedness. Sax, even in its so-called 'strict mode', is not strict. It   silently accepts structures that are not well-formed XML. Projects that need   better compliance with well-formedness constraints cannot use sax as-is.    Consequently, saxes does not support HTML, or pseudo-XML, or bad XML. Saxes   will report well-formedness errors in all these cases but it won't try to   extract data from malformed documents like sax does.  * Saxes is much much faster than sax, mostly because of a substantial redesign   of the internal parsing logic. The speed improvement is not merely due to   removing features that were supported by sax. That helped a bit, but saxes   adds some expensive checks in its aim for conformance with the XML   specification. Redesigning the parsing logic is what accounts for most of the   performance improvement.  * Saxes does not aim to support antiquated platforms. We will not pollute the   source or the default build with support for antiquated platforms. If you want   support for IE 11, you are welcome to produce a PR that adds a *new build*   transpiled to ES5.  * Saxes handles errors differently from sax: it provides a default onerror   handler which throws. You can replace it with your own handler if you want. If   your handler does nothing, there is no `resume` method to call.  * There's no `Stream` API. A revamped API may be introduced later. (It is still   a 'streaming parser' in the general sense that you write a character stream to   it.)  * Saxes does not have facilities for limiting the size the data chunks passed to   event handlers. See the FAQ entry for more details.  ## Conformance  Saxes supports:  * [XML 1.0 fifth edition](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/) * [XML 1.1 second edition](https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml11-20060816/) * [Namespaces in XML 1.0 (Third Edition)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-xml-names-20091208/). * [Namespaces in XML 1.1 (Second Edition)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml-names11-20060816/).  ## Limitations  This is a non-validating parser so it only verifies whether the document is well-formed. We do aim to raise errors for all malformed constructs encountered. However, this parser does not thorougly parse the contents of DTDs. So most malformedness errors caused by errors **in DTDs** cannot be reported.  ## Regarding `<!DOCTYPE` and `<!ENTITY`  The parser will handle the basic XML entities in text nodes and attribute values: `&amp;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

@cypress/react@5.9.1;cypress/react@5.9.1;5.9.1;@cypress/react;37139;Unit test React components using Cypress;https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress;;;;MIT;;/Users/clemensw/Projekte/VW/DPP/erfassungs-app/node_modules/@cypress/react/README.md;> A little helper to unit test React components in the open source [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/) test runner **v7.0.0+**  **Jump to:** [Comparison](#comparison), [Blog posts](#blog-posts), [Install](#install), Examples: [basic](#basic-examples), [advanced](#advanced-examples), [full](#full-examples), [external](#external-examples), [Style options](#options), [Code coverage](#code-coverage), [Visual testing](#visual-testing), [Common problems](#common-problems), [Chat](#chat)  ## TLDR  - What is this? This package allows you to use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) test runner to unit test your React components with zero effort. Here is a typical component testing, notice there is not external URL shown, since it is mounting the component directly.  ![Example component test](images/dynamic.gif)  - How is this different from [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) or [RTL](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)? It is similar in functionality BUT runs the component in the real browser with full power of Cypress E2E test runner: [live GUI, full API, screen recording, CI support, cross-platform](https://www.cypress.io/features/), and [visual testing](https://on.cypress.io/visual-testing).  - If you like using `@testing-library/react`, you can use `@testing-library/cypress` for the same `findBy`, `queryBy` commands, see one of the examples in the list below - Read [My Vision for Component Tests in Cypress](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/my-vision-for-component-tests/) by Gleb Bahmutov  ## Comparison  <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> Feature | Jest / Enzyme / RTL | Cypress + `@cypress/react` --- | --- | --- Test runs in real browser | ❌ | ✅ Supports shallow mount | ✅ | ❌ Supports full mount | ✅ | ✅ Test speed | 🏎 | [as fast as the app works in the browser](#fast-enough) Test can use additional plugins | maybe | use any [Cypress plugin](https://on.cypress.io/plugins) Test can interact with component | synthetic limited API | use any [Cypress command](https://on.cypress.io/api) Test can be debugged | via terminal and Node debugger | use browser DevTools Built-in time traveling debugger | ❌ | Cypress time traveling debugger Re-run tests on file or test change | ✅ | ✅ Test output on CI | terminal | terminal, screenshots, videos Tests can be run in parallel | ✅ | ✅ via [parallelization](https://on.cypress.io/parallelization) Test against interface | if using `@testing-library/react` | ✅ and can use `@testing-library/cypress` Spying and stubbing methods | Jest mocks | [Sinon library](https://on.cypress.io/stubs-spies-and-clocks) Stubbing imports | ✅ | ✅ Stubbing clock | ✅ | ✅ Code coverage | ✅ | ✅ <!-- prettier-ignore-end -->  If you are coming from Jest + RTL world, read [Test The Interface Not The Implementation](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/test-the-interface/).  If you are coming from Enzyme world, check out the [enzyme](cypress/component/basic/enzyme) example.  ## Blog posts  - [My Vision for Component Tests in Cypress](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/my-vision-for-component-tests/) - [Unit Testing React components with Cypress](https://itnext.io/unit-testing-react-components-with-cypress-4d4cf8cd59a0) - [Test React Component with @cypress/react Example](https://dev.to/bahmutov/test-react-component-with-@cypress/react-example-4d99) - [Tic-Tac-Toe Component Tests](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/tic-tac-toe-component-tests/) - [Using .env and .env.test from React component tests](https://medium.com/@bahmutov/using-env-and-env-test-from-react-component-tests-c11aa2040bc8) - [Visual testing for React components using open source tools](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/open-source-visual-testing-of-components/) - [12 Recipes for testing React applications using @cypress/react](https://dev.to/bahmutov/12-recipes-for-testing-react-applications-using-@cypress/react-46g6) (compare to [12 Recipes for testing React applications using Testing Library](https://dev.to/jooforja/12-recipes-for-testing-react-applications-using-testing-library-1bh2#portal)) - [Cypress Unit Testing React Components With TypeScript](https://medium.com/swlh/cypress-unit-testing-react-components-with-typescript-77b38e5043b3) - [Test The Interface Not The Implementation](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/test-the-interface/) compares Jest + React Testing Library to @cypress/react + Cypress Testing Library - [Components People Test](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/components-people-test/) about testing a component inside a Next.js-powered blog  ## Install  Requires [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 12 or above.  ```sh npm install --save-dev cypress @cypress/react @cypress/webpack-dev-server ```  ## Init  You can use our command line wizard to give you instructions on configuring this plugin. It will try to determine which framework or bundling tool you are using and give you instructions on right configuration.  ```sh npx create-cypress-tests --component-tests ```  Or continue with manual installation in the plugin file  1. Tell Cypress how your React application is transpiled or bundled (using Webpack), so Cypress can load your components. For example, if you use `react-scripts` (even after ejecting) do:  ```js // cypress/plugins/index.js module.exports = (on, config) => {   require('@cypress/react/plugins/react-scripts')(on, config)   // IMPORTANT to return the config object   // with the any changed environment variables   return config } ```  See [Recipes](./docs/recipes.md) for more examples.  2. You can specify where component spec files are located. For example, to have them located in `src` folder use:  ```json {   'componentFolder': 'src' } ```  ## API  - `mount` is the most important function, allows to mount a given React component as a mini web application and interact with it using Cypress commands - `createMount` factory function that creates new `mount` function with default options - `unmount` removes previously mounted component, mostly useful to test how the component cleans up after itself - `mountHook` mounts a given React Hook in a test component for full testing, see `hooks` example  ## Examples  ```js import React from 'react' import { mount } from '@cypress/react' import { HelloWorld } from './hello-world.jsx' describe('HelloWorld component', () => {   it('works', () => {     mount(<HelloWorld />)     // now use standard Cypress commands     cy.contains('Hello World!').should('be.visible')   }) }) ```  Look at the examples in [cypress/component](cypress/component) folder.

If you need another CSS, the simplest way is to import it from the spec file:  ```js // src/Footer.spec.js import './styles/main.css' import Footer from './Footer' it('looks right', () => {   // styles are applied   mount(<Footer />) }) ```  ### Extra styles  You can pass additional styles, css files and external stylesheets to load, see [docs/styles.md](./docs/styles.md) for the full list of options.  ```js const todo = {   id: '123',   title: 'Write more tests', } mount(<Todo todo={todo} />, {   stylesheets: [     'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bulma/0.7.2/css/bulma.css',   ], }) ```  <details> <summary>Additional configuration</summary> If your React and React DOM libraries are installed in non-standard paths (think monorepo scenario), you can tell this plugin where to find them. In `cypress.json` specify paths like this:  ```json {   'env': {     '@cypress/react': {       'react': 'node_modules/react/umd/react.development.js',       'react-dom': 'node_modules/react-dom/umd/react-dom.development.js'     }   } } ```  </details>  You may also specify the `ReactDOM` package to use. This can be useful in complex monorepo setups that have different versions of React and React DOM installed. If you see an error relating to [mismatching versions of React or React DOM](https://reactjs.org/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning.html#mismatching-versions-of-react-and-react-dom), this may be the solution. You can do this using the `ReactDom` option:  ```jsx // if you have multiple versions of ReactDom in your monorepo import ReactDom from 'react-dom'  mount(<Todo todo={todo} />, {   stylesheets: [     'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bulma/0.7.2/css/bulma.css',   ],   ReactDom }) ```  ## Code coverage  In order to use code coverage you can follow the instructions from [docs](https://github.com/cypress-io/code-coverage). In most of cases you need to install 2 dependencies:   ``` npm i @cypress/code-coverage babel-plugin-istanbul  yarn add @cypress/code-coverage babel-plugin-istanbul ```  If you are using [plugins/cra-v3](plugins/cra-v3) it instruments the code on the fly using `babel-plugin-istanbul` and generates report using dependency [cypress-io/code-coverage](https://github.com/cypress-io/code-coverage) (included). If you want to disable code coverage instrumentation and reporting, use `--env coverage=false` or `CYPRESS_coverage=false` or set in your `cypress.json` file  ```json {   'env': {     'coverage': false   } } ```  ## Visual testing  You can use any Cypress [Visual Testing plugin](https://on.cypress.io/plugins#visual-testing) to perform [visual testing](https://on.cypress.io/visual-testing) from the component tests. This repo has several example projects, see [visual-sudoku](examples/visual-sudoku), [visual-testing-with-percy](examples/visual-testing-with-percy), [visual-testing-with-happo](examples/visual-testing-with-happo), and [visual-testing-with-applitools](examples/visual-testing-with-applitools).  For a larger Do-It-Yourself example with an hour long list of explanation videos, see [bahmutov/sudoku](https://github.com/bahmutov/sudoku) repository. I explain how to write visual testing using open source tools in this [blog post](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/open-source-visual-testing-of-components/), [video talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00BNExlJUU8), and [slides](https://slides.com/bahmutov/i-see-what-is-going-on).  ## Common problems  <details id='fast-enough'>   <summary>Slower than Jest</summary>  When you use `cypress-X-unit-test` for component testing, you might notice the tests are slower than using Jest to test the same components. Yes, that's true. A test runner could be made _extremely_ fast if it did nothing, just check out the [auchenberg/volkswagen](https://github.com/auchenberg/volkswagen) test runner - it is blazing on CI 😉. Of course, Jest does do things, just not inside the real browser environment.  Testing using Jest with its jsdom browser is faster than starting the real browser, loading all libraries, mounting the component and then waiting for the component to actually perform its work in response to the test's actions. But do those tests give you a true confidence that the component is working?  Try this test 🙈  Spoiler: it fails, [proof](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-testing-library-demo-forked-z7l2o?file=/src/__tests__/components.js).  ```js const mock = jest.fn() // render a component that does NOT allow any click events // using pointerEvents: 'none' style const { getByRole } = render(   <button style={{ pointerEvents: 'none' }} onClick={mock}>     text   </button>, ) // Jest happily clicks fireEvent.click(getByRole('button')) expect(mock).not.toBeCalled() ```  Cypress test on the other hand [fails correctly](cypress/component/basic/fails-correctly).  We think that using `cypress-X-unit-test` runs tests as _fast as your application code is_, and often you need to think how to _slow down_ the Cypress Test Runner so it does not run away from the component's code, just see our blog posts dealing with [test flake](https://cypress.io/blog/tag/flake/).  From the developer's perspective I would ask myself: which tests do I _write faster_? What happens when a test fails and I need to debug the failure: which test runner allows me to _debug a failed test quicker_? While I am partial, I have to say, realistic Cypress tests are easier to write and debug.  Finally, when running tests on the continuous integration service, the true test speed up comes from properly configuring [dependencies caching](https://on.cypress.io/caching) and running [tests in parallel](https://on.cypress.io/parallelization) - something we have extensively documented and consider a solved problem.  </details>  ## Context Provider usage  React context provider usage and API described in [./docs/providers-and-composition.md](./docs/providers-and-composition.md)  ## Chat  Come chat with us [on discord](https://discord.gg/7ZHYhZSW) in the #component-testing channel.  ## Development  See [docs/development.md](./docs/development.md)  ## Debugging  You can see verbose logs from this plugin by running with environment variable  ``` DEBUG=@cypress/react ```  Because finding and modifying Webpack settings while running this plugin is done by [find-webpack](https://github.com/bahmutov/find-webpack) module, you might want to enable its debug messages too.  ``` DEBUG=@cypress/react,find-webpack ```  ## Changelog  [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md)  ## Related tools  Same feature for unit testing components from other frameworks using Cypress  - [@cypress/vue](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/develop/npm/vue) - [cypress-cycle-unit-test](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-cycle-unit-test) - [cypress-svelte-unit-test](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-svelte-unit-test) - [@cypress/angular](https://github.com/bahmutov/@cypress/angular) - [cypress-hyperapp-unit-test](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-hyperapp-unit-test) - [cypress-angularjs-unit-test](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-angularjs-unit-test);no;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
@cypress/webpack-dev-server@1.3.1;cypress/webpack-dev-server@1.3.1;1.3.1;@cypress/webpack-dev-server;36951;Launches Webpack Dev Server for Component Testing;https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress;;;;MIT;;/Users/clemensw/Projekte/VW/DPP/erfassungs-app/node_modules/@cypress/webpack-dev-server/README.md;# @cypress/webpack-dev-server  > **Note** this package is not meant to be used outside of cypress component testing.  Install `@cypress/vue` or `@cypress/react` to get this package working properly  To install `@cypress/webpack-dev-server` in you component testing environment, 1. Install it `yarn add @cypress/webpack-dev-server` 2. Add it to `cypress/plugins/index.js`  ```js import { startDevServer } from '@cypress/webpack-dev-server'  module.exports = (on, config) => {   on('dev-server:start', async (options) => startDevServer({ options }))    return config } ```  ## Architecture  ### Cypress server  - Every HTTP request goes to the cypress server which returns an html page. We call 'TOP' because of its name in the dev tools     This page     - renders the list of spec files     - And the timetraveling command log     - Finally, it renders an AUT Iframe. this iframe calls a url that has 2 parts concatenated.         - a prefix: `__cypress/iframes/`          - the path to the current. For example: `src/components/button.spec.tsx` - In the cypress server, calls prefixed with `__cypress/iframes/...` will be passed to the dev-server as `__cypress/src/index.html` - Every call with the prefix `__cypress/src/` will be passed to the dev-server to deal as is, without changes.  ### Dev-server  - Responds to every query with the prefix `__cypress/src/` (base path should be this prefix). - Responds to `__cypress/src/index.html` with an html page.      This page     - will contain an element `<div id='__cy_root'></div>` to attach the mounted components to.     - will load support files     - will load the current spec from the url     - will start the test when both files are done loading - The server re-runs the tests as soon as the current spec or any dependency is updated by calling an event `devServerEvents.emit('dev-server:compile:success')`  ## Webpack  Webpack-dev-server fulfills his reponsibilities by  - Making a `webpack.config` from the users setup by changing the entrypoint to `browser.ts` - Launches the webpack dev server with `devServer.publicPath = '__cypress/src/'` and `devServer.hot = false` - The entry point (`browser.ts`) delegates the loading of spec files to the loader.      - By using a require on itself, it enables using a custom loader and Hot Module Replacements if hot is false. - The plugin is responsible for passing down the path to the support files and the list of specs discovered by the cypress server to the loader - The loader:     - compares the url with each spec path given by the plugin     - picks the spec that should be run     - runs the `AUT-Runner.ts` to load and launch the support file and the current spec  ## API  `startDevServer` takes an object of options.  - `options` (required): this contains various internal configuration. It's provided as the first argument to the `dev-server:start` event. Just make sure you pass it to the `startDevServer`. - `webpackConfig` (optional): the webpack config used by your application. We provide some [presets](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/develop/npm/react/plugins), but you can pass the `webpackConfig` manually, too. - `template` (optional): by default [this index.html](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/npm/webpack-dev-server/index-template.html) is used. You can provide your own using this option. This is useful if you'd like to include some CDN links, or in some way customize the default html. If you are passing this option, ensure your `index.html` contains the same content as [the default template](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/npm/webpack-dev-server/index-template.html). Some of our presets include a custom `index.html`, such as [Next](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/develop/npm/react/plugins/next).   See [npm/react/plugins/next](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/npm/react/plugins/next/index.js) for a full example using all the options.  ## Performance tests   In order to get webpack performance statistics run `yarn cypress open-ct` or `yarn cypress run-ct` with `WEBPACK_PERF_MEASURE` env variable:  ```sh WEBPACK_PERF_MEASURE=true yarn cypress run-ct ```  This will output the timings of whole webpack output and timings for each specified plugin and loader.   ### Compare results  In order to run performance tests and compare timings with the previous build run:  ```sh WEBPACK_PERF_MEASURE=true WEBPACK_PERF_MEASURE_COMPARE={name-of-project} yarn cypress run-ct ```  This will create the file `./__perf-stats/{name-of-project}.json` or if this file exists will compare results with the previously saved version.   In order to update the `{name-of-project}.json` file and use new stats as a base for the next comparisons run:    ```sh WEBPACK_PERF_MEASURE=true WEBPACK_PERF_MEASURE_UPDATE=true WEBPACK_PERF_MEASURE_COMPARE={name-of-project} yarn cypress run-ct ```  ## Changelog  [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md);no;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/chokidar.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chokidar)  ## Why? Node.js `fs.watch`:  * Doesn't report filenames on MacOS. * Doesn't report events at all when using editors like Sublime on MacOS. * Often reports events twice. * Emits most changes as `rename`. * Has [a lot of other issues](https://github.com/nodejs/node/search?q=fs.watch&type=Issues) * Does not provide an easy way to recursively watch file trees.  Node.js `fs.watchFile`:  * Almost as bad at event handling. * Also does not provide any recursive watching. * Results in high CPU utilization.  Chokidar resolves these problems.  Initially made for **[Brunch](http://brunch.io)** (an ultra-swift web app build tool), it is now used in [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/), [karma](http://karma-runner.github.io), [PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/PM2), [browserify](http://browserify.org/), [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/), [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/), [Microsoft's Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode), and [many others](https://www.npmjs.org/browse/depended/chokidar/). It has proven itself in production environments.  ## How? Chokidar does still rely on the Node.js core `fs` module, but when using `fs.watch` and `fs.watchFile` for watching, it normalizes the events it receives, often checking for truth by getting file stats and/or dir contents.  On MacOS, chokidar by default uses a native extension exposing the Darwin `FSEvents` API. This provides very efficient recursive watching compared with implementations like `kqueue` available on most \*nix platforms. Chokidar still does have to do some work to normalize the events received that way as well.  On other platforms, the `fs.watch`-based implementation is the default, which avoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate watchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been specified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much more than needed.  ## Getting started Install with npm:  ```sh npm install chokidar ```  Then `require` and use it in your code:  ```javascript var chokidar = require('chokidar');;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

NOTE: Please take a look at http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/ before choosing a curve for your cryptography operations.  ## Incentive  ECC is much slower than regular RSA cryptography, the JS implementations are even more slower.  ## Benchmarks  ```bash $ node benchmarks/index.js Benchmarking: sign elliptic#sign x 262 ops/sec ±0.51% (177 runs sampled) eccjs#sign x 55.91 ops/sec ±0.90% (144 runs sampled) ------------------------ Fastest is elliptic#sign ======================== Benchmarking: verify elliptic#verify x 113 ops/sec ±0.50% (166 runs sampled) eccjs#verify x 48.56 ops/sec ±0.36% (125 runs sampled) ------------------------ Fastest is elliptic#verify ======================== Benchmarking: gen elliptic#gen x 294 ops/sec ±0.43% (176 runs sampled) eccjs#gen x 62.25 ops/sec ±0.63% (129 runs sampled) ------------------------ Fastest is elliptic#gen ======================== Benchmarking: ecdh elliptic#ecdh x 136 ops/sec ±0.85% (156 runs sampled) ------------------------ Fastest is elliptic#ecdh ======================== ```  ## API  ### ECDSA  ```javascript var EC = require('elliptic').ec;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature)); ```  ### ECDH  ```javascript var EC = require('elliptic').ec; var ec = new EC('curve25519');  // Generate keys var key1 = ec.genKeyPair(); var key2 = ec.genKeyPair();  var shared1 = key1.derive(key2.getPublic()); var shared2 = key2.derive(key1.getPublic());  console.log('Both shared secrets are BN instances'); console.log(shared1.toString(16)); console.log(shared2.toString(16)); ```  three and more members: ```javascript var EC = require('elliptic').ec; var ec = new EC('curve25519');  var A = ec.genKeyPair(); var B = ec.genKeyPair(); var C = ec.genKeyPair();"  var AB = A.getPublic().mul(B.getPrivate()) var BC = B.getPublic().mul(C.getPrivate()) var CA = C.getPublic().mul(A.getPrivate())  var ABC = AB.mul(C.getPrivate()) var BCA = BC.mul(A.getPrivate()) var CAB = CA.mul(B.getPrivate())  console.log(ABC.getX().toString(16)) console.log(BCA.getX().toString(16)) console.log(CAB.getX().toString(16)) ```  NOTE: `.derive()` returns a [BN][1] instance.  ## Supported curves  Elliptic.js support following curve types:  * Short Weierstrass * Montgomery * Edwards * Twisted Edwards  Following curve 'presets' are embedded into the library:  * `secp256k1` * `p192` * `p224` * `p256` * `p384` * `p521` * `curve25519` * `ed25519`  NOTE: That `curve25519` could not be used for ECDSA, use `ed25519` instead.  ### Implementation details  ECDSA is using deterministic `k` value generation as per [RFC6979][0]. Most of the curve operations are performed on non-affine coordinates (either projective or extended), various windowing techniques are used for different cases.  All operations are performed in reduction context using [bn.js][1], hashing is provided by [hash.js][2]  ### Related projects  * [eccrypto][3]: isomorphic implementation of ECDSA, ECDH and ECIES for both   browserify and node (uses `elliptic` for browser and [secp256k1-node][4] for   node)  #### LICENSE  This software is licensed under the MIT License.

Available in npm as *errno*.  [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/errno.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/errno) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rvagg/node-errno.png)](http://travis-ci.org/rvagg/node-errno) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/errno.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/errno)  * [errno exposed](#errnoexposed) * [Custom errors](#customerrors)  <a name='errnoexposed'></a> ## errno exposed  Ever find yourself needing more details about Node.js errors? Me too, so *node-errno* contains the errno mappings direct from libuv so you can use them in your code.  **By errno:**  ```js require('errno').errno[3] // → { //     'errno': 3, //     'code': 'EACCES', //     'description': 'permission denied' //   } ```  **By code:**  ```js require('errno').code.ENOTEMPTY // → { //     'errno': 53, //     'code': 'ENOTEMPTY', //     'description': 'directory not empty' //   } ```  **Make your errors more descriptive:**  ```js var errno = require('errno')  function errmsg(err) {   var str = 'Error: '   // if it's a libuv error then get the description from errno   if (errno.errno[err.errno])     str += errno.errno[err.errno].description   else     str += err.message    // if it's a `fs` error then it'll have a 'path' property   if (err.path)     str += ' [' + err.path + ']'    return str }  var fs = require('fs')  fs.readFile('thisisnotarealfile.txt', function (err, data) {   if (err)     console.log(errmsg(err)) }) ```  **Use as a command line tool:**  ``` ~ $ errno 53 {   'errno': 53,   'code': 'ENOTEMPTY',   'description': 'directory not empty' } ~ $ errno EROFS {   'errno': 56,   'code': 'EROFS',   'description': 'read-only file system' } ~ $ errno foo No such errno/code: 'foo' ```  Supply no arguments for the full list. Error codes are processed case-insensitive.  You will need to install with `npm install errno -g` if you want the `errno` command to be available without supplying a full path to the node_modules installation.  <a name='customerrors'></a> ## Custom errors  Use `errno.custom.createError()` to create custom `Error` objects to throw around in your Node.js library. Create error hierarchies so `instanceof` becomes a useful tool in tracking errors. Call-stack is correctly captured at the time you create an instance of the error object, plus a `cause` property will make available the original error object if you pass one in to the constructor.  ```js var create = require('errno').custom.createError var MyError = create('MyError') // inherits from Error var SpecificError = create('SpecificError', MyError) // inherits from MyError var OtherError = create('OtherError', MyError)  // use them! if (condition) throw new SpecificError('Eeek! Something bad happened')  if (err) return callback(new OtherError(err)) ```  Also available is a `errno.custom.FilesystemError` with in-built access to errno properties:  ```js fs.readFile('foo', function (err, data) {   if (err) return callback(new errno.custom.FilesystemError(err))   // do something else }) ```  The resulting error object passed through the callback will have the following properties: `code`, `errno`, `path` and `message` will contain a descriptive human-readable message.  ## Contributors  * [bahamas10](https://github.com/bahamas10) (Dave Eddy) - Added CLI * [ralphtheninja](https://github.com/ralphtheninja) (Lars-Magnus Skog)  ## Copyright & Licence  *Copyright (c) 2012-2015 [Rod Vagg](https://github.com/rvagg) ([@rvagg](https://twitter.com/rvagg))*  Made available under the MIT licence:  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

faye-websocket@0.10.0;faye-websocket@0.10.0;0.10.0;faye-websocket;0.10.0;Standards-compliant WebSocket server and client;https://github.com/faye/faye-websocket-node;;;;MIT;Copyright (c) 2010-2015 James Coglan;/Users/clemensw/Projekte/VW/DPP/erfassungs-app/node_modules/faye-websocket/README.md;# faye-websocket  * Travis CI build: [![Build   status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/faye/faye-websocket-node.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/faye/faye-websocket-node) * Autobahn tests: [server](http://faye.jcoglan.com/autobahn/servers/),   [client](http://faye.jcoglan.com/autobahn/clients/)  This is a general-purpose WebSocket implementation extracted from the [Faye](http://faye.jcoglan.com) project. It provides classes for easily building WebSocket servers and clients in Node. It does not provide a server itself, but rather makes it easy to handle WebSocket connections within an existing [Node](http://nodejs.org/) application. It does not provide any abstraction other than the standard [WebSocket API](http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/).  It also provides an abstraction for handling [EventSource](http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource/) connections, which are one-way connections that allow the server to push data to the client. They are based on streaming HTTP responses and can be easier to access via proxies than WebSockets.   ## Installation  ``` $ npm install faye-websocket ```   ## Handling WebSocket connections in Node  You can handle WebSockets on the server side by listening for HTTP Upgrade requests, and creating a new socket for the request. This socket object exposes the usual WebSocket methods for receiving and sending messages. For example this is how you'd implement an echo server:  ```js var WebSocket = require('faye-websocket'),     http      = require('http');;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;          es.on('close', function() {       clearInterval(loop);       es = null;     });      } else {     // Normal HTTP request     response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});     response.end('Hello');   } });  server.listen(8000); ```  The `send` method takes two optional parameters, `event` and `id`. The default event-type is `'message'` with no ID. For example, to send a `notification` event with ID `99`:  ```js es.send('Breaking News!', {event: 'notification', id: '99'}); ```  The `EventSource` object exposes the following properties:  * <b>`url`</b> is a string containing the URL the client used to create the   EventSource. * <b>`lastEventId`</b> is a string containing the last event ID received by the   client. You can use this when the client reconnects after a dropped connection   to determine which messages need resending.  When you initialize an EventSource with ` new EventSource()`, you can pass configuration options after the `response` parameter. Available options are:  * <b>`headers`</b> is an object containing custom headers to be set on the   EventSource response. * <b>`retry`</b> is a number that tells the client how long (in seconds) it   should wait after a dropped connection before attempting to reconnect. * <b>`ping`</b> is a number that tells the server how often (in seconds) to send   'ping' packets to the client to keep the connection open, to defeat timeouts   set by proxies. The client will ignore these messages.  For example, this creates a connection that allows access from any origin, pings every 15 seconds and is retryable every 10 seconds if the connection is broken:  ```js var es = new EventSource(request, response, {   headers: {'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'},   ping:    15,   retry:   10 }); ```  You can send a ping message at any time by calling `es.ping()`. Unlike WebSocket, the client does not send a response to this;" it is merely to send some data over the wire to keep the connection alive.   ## License  (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2010-2015 James Coglan  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

imurmurhash@0.1.4;imurmurhash@0.1.4;0.1.4;imurmurhash;0.1.4;An incremental implementation of MurmurHash3;https://github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js;;;;MIT;;/Users/clemensw/Projekte/VW/DPP/erfassungs-app/node_modules/imurmurhash/README.md;iMurmurHash.js ==============  An incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).  This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.  Installation ------------  To use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.  ```html <script type='text/javascript' src='/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js'></script> <script> // Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3 </script> ```  ---  To use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:  ```bash npm install imurmurhash ```  Then simply include it in your scripts:  ```javascript MurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The default resolver will already use PnP.  Simply add the resolver to your configuration. For example, a minimal `jest.config.js` would be as such:  ```js module.exports = {   resolver: require.resolve(`jest-pnp-resolver`) };;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This project will be updated as the standards change.  ## JSON data ##  See the [language-subtag-registry](https://github.com/mattcg/language-subtag-registry) project for the underlying JSON data.  ## API ##  ```js var tags = require('language-tags') ```  Note that all lookups and checks for tags and subtags are case insensitive. For formatting according to common conventions, see `tag.format`.  ### tags(tag) ###  Check whether a hyphen-separated tag is valid and well-formed. Always returns a `Tag`, which can be checked using the `valid` method.  ### tags.check(tag) ###  Shortcut for `tags(tag).valid()`. Return `true` if the tag is valid, `false` otherwise. For meaningful error output see `tag.errors()`.  ### tags.subtags(subtag), tags.subtags(subtags) ###  Look up one or more subtags. Returns an array of `Subtag` objects. Returns an empty array if all of the subtags are non-existent.  Calling `tags.subtags('mt')` will return an array with two `Subtag` objects: one for Malta (the 'region' type subtag) and one for Maltese (the 'language' type subtag).  ``` > tags.subtags('mt');;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HERE BEGINS THE INTERESTING STUFF 🚨 -->  ## Wut? Poppers?  A popper is an element on the screen which 'pops out' from the natural flow of your application.   Common examples of poppers are tooltips, popovers and drop-downs.   ## So, yet another tooltip library?  Well, basically, **no**.   Popper.js is a **positioning engine**, its purpose is to calculate the position of an element to make it possible to position it near a given reference element.    The engine is completely modular and most of its features are implemented as **modifiers** (similar to middlewares or plugins).   The whole code base is written in ES2015 and its features are automatically tested on real browsers thanks to [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com/) and [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/).  Popper.js has zero dependencies. No jQuery, no LoDash, nothing.   It's used by big companies like [Twitter in Bootstrap v4](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Microsoft in WebClipper](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/WebClipper) and [Atlassian in AtlasKit](https://aui-cdn.atlassian.com/atlaskit/registry/).  ### Popper.js  This is the engine, the library that computes and, optionally, applies the styles to the poppers.  Some of the key points are:  - Position elements keeping them in their original DOM context (doesn't mess with your DOM!);;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

sane@4.1.0;sane@4.1.0;4.1.0;sane;36529;Sane aims to be fast, small, and reliable file system watcher.;https://github.com/amasad/sane;;;;MIT;;/Users/clemensw/Projekte/VW/DPP/erfassungs-app/node_modules/sane/README.md;[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/amasad/sane.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/amasad/sane)  sane ----  I've been driven to insanity by node filesystem watcher wrappers. Sane aims to be fast, small, and reliable file system watcher. It does that by:  * By default stays away from fs polling because it's very slow and cpu intensive * Uses `fs.watch` by default and sensibly works around the various issues * Maintains a consistent API across different platforms * Where `fs.watch` is not reliable you have the choice of using the following alternatives:   * [the facebook watchman library](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/)   * [the watchexec library](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec)   * polling  ## Install  ``` $ npm install sane ```  ## How to choose a mode  Don't worry too much about choosing the correct mode upfront because sane maintains the same API across all modes and will be easy to switch.  * If you're only supporting Linux and OS X, `watchman` would be the most reliable mode * If you're using node > v0.10.0 use the default mode * If you're running OS X and you're watching a lot of directories and you're running into https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/5463, use `watchman` * If you're in an environment where native file system events aren't available (like Vagrant), you should use polling * Otherwise, the default mode should work well for you  ## API  ### sane(dir, options)  Watches a directory and all its descendant directories for changes, deletions, and additions on files and directories.  ```js var watcher = sane('path/to/dir', {glob: ['**/*.js', '**/*.css']});;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This module named `spdy` but it [provides](https://github.com/indutny/node-spdy/issues/269#issuecomment-239014184) support for both http/2 (h2) and spdy (2,3,3.1).

stable@0.1.8;stable@0.1.8;0.1.8;stable;0.1.8;A stable array sort for JavaScript;https://github.com/Two-Screen/stable;;;;MIT;Copyright (C) 2018 Angry Bytes and contributors.;/Users/clemensw/Projekte/VW/DPP/erfassungs-app/node_modules/stable/README.md;## Stable  A stable array sort, because `Array#sort()` is not guaranteed stable.  MIT licensed.  [![Node.js CI](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Two-Screen/stable.png)](http://travis-ci.org/Two-Screen/stable)  [![Browser CI](http://ci.testling.com/Two-Screen/stable.png)](http://ci.testling.com/Two-Screen/stable)  #### From npm  Install with:  ```sh npm install stable ```  Then use it in Node.js or some other CommonJS environment as:  ```js const stable = require('stable') ```  #### From the browser  Include [`stable.js`] or the minified version [`stable.min.js`] in your page, then call `stable()`.   [`stable.js`]: https://raw.github.com/Two-Screen/stable/master/stable.js  [`stable.min.js`]: https://raw.github.com/Two-Screen/stable/master/stable.min.js  #### Usage  The default sort is, as with `Array#sort`, lexicographical:  ```js stable(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'])  // => ['bar', 'baz', 'foo'] stable([10, 1, 5])             // => [1, 10, 5] ```  Unlike `Array#sort`, the default sort is **NOT** in-place. To do an in-place sort, use `stable.inplace`, which otherwise works the same:  ```js const arr = [10, 1, 5] stable(arr) === arr          // => false stable.inplace(arr) === arr  // => true ```  A comparator function can be specified:  ```js // Regular sort() compatible comparator, that returns a number. // This demonstrates the default behavior. const lexCmp = (a, b) => String(a).localeCompare(b) stable(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'], lexCmp)  // => ['bar', 'baz', 'foo']  // Boolean comparator. Sorts `b` before `a` if true. // This demonstrates a simple way to sort numerically. const greaterThan = (a, b) => a > b stable([10, 1, 5], greaterThan)  // => [1, 5, 10] ```  #### License  Copyright (C) 2018 Angry Bytes and contributors.

If you just want to write TypeScript and have it Just Work™, take a look at [`pnp-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/arcanis/pnp-webpack-plugin#ts-loader-integration) instead.*  This package exports a function that can be used to implement the [`resolveModuleName` hook from `CompilerHost`](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Using-the-Compiler-API#customizing-module-resolution). It mimics the interface from the one you'd typically use and, as all other PnP plugins, works just fine whether your application is actually running under PnP or not.  ```js import {resolveModuleName} from 'ts-pnp';;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

websocket-driver@0.6.5;websocket-driver@0.6.5;0.6.5;websocket-driver;0.6.5;WebSocket protocol handler with pluggable I/O;https://github.com/faye/websocket-driver-node;;;;MIT;Copyright (c) 2010-2016 James Coglan;/Users/clemensw/Projekte/VW/DPP/erfassungs-app/node_modules/sockjs/node_modules/websocket-driver/README.md;# websocket-driver [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/faye/websocket-driver-node.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/faye/websocket-driver-node)  This module provides a complete implementation of the WebSocket protocols that can be hooked up to any I/O stream. It aims to simplify things by decoupling the protocol details from the I/O layer, such that users only need to implement code to stream data in and out of it without needing to know anything about how the protocol actually works. Think of it as a complete WebSocket system with pluggable I/O.  Due to this design, you get a lot of things for free. In particular, if you hook this module up to some I/O object, it will do all of this for you:  * Select the correct server-side driver to talk to the client * Generate and send both server- and client-side handshakes * Recognize when the handshake phase completes and the WS protocol begins * Negotiate subprotocol selection based on `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` * Negotiate and use extensions via the   [websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node)   module * Buffer sent messages until the handshake process is finished * Deal with proxies that defer delivery of the draft-76 handshake body * Notify you when the socket is open and closed and when messages arrive * Recombine fragmented messages * Dispatch text, binary, ping, pong and close frames * Manage the socket-closing handshake process * Automatically reply to ping frames with a matching pong * Apply masking to messages sent by the client  This library was originally extracted from the [Faye](http://faye.jcoglan.com) project but now aims to provide simple WebSocket support for any Node-based project.   ## Installation  ``` $ npm install websocket-driver ```   ## Usage  This module provides protocol drivers that have the same interface on the server and on the client. A WebSocket driver is an object with two duplex streams attached;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; });  proxy.on('connect', function() {   driver.io.pipe(tcp).pipe(driver.io);   driver.start(); });  driver.messages.on('data', function(message) {   console.log('Got a message', message); }); ```  The proxy's `connect` event is also where you should perform a TLS handshake on your TCP stream, if you are connecting to a `wss:` endpoint.  In the event that proxy connection fails, `proxy` will emit an `error`. You can inspect the proxy's response via `proxy.statusCode` and `proxy.headers`.  ```js proxy.on('error', function(error) {   console.error(error.message);   console.log(proxy.statusCode);   console.log(proxy.headers); }); ```  Before calling `proxy.start()` you can set custom headers using `proxy.setHeader()`:  ```js proxy.setHeader('User-Agent', 'node'); proxy.start(); ```   ### Driver API  Drivers are created using one of the following methods:  ```js driver = websocket.http(request, options) driver = websocket.server(options) driver = websocket.client(url, options) ```  The `http` method returns a driver chosen using the headers from a Node HTTP request object. The `server` method returns a driver that will parse an HTTP request and then decide which driver to use for it using the `http` method. The `client` method always returns a driver for the RFC version of the protocol with masking enabled on outgoing frames.  The `options` argument is optional, and is an object. It may contain the following fields:  * `maxLength` - the maximum allowed size of incoming message frames, in bytes.   The default value is `2^26 - 1`, or 1 byte short of 64 MiB. * `protocols` - an array of strings representing acceptable subprotocols for use   over the socket. The driver will negotiate one of these to use via the   `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header if supported by the other peer.  A driver has two duplex streams attached to it:  * <b>`driver.io`</b> - this stream should be attached to an I/O socket like a   TCP stream. Pipe incoming TCP chunks to this stream for them to be parsed, and   pipe this stream back into TCP to send outgoing frames. * <b>`driver.messages`</b> - this stream emits messages received over the   WebSocket.  Writing to it sends messages to the other peer by emitting frames   via the `driver.io` stream.  All drivers respond to the following API methods, but some of them are no-ops depending on whether the client supports the behaviour.  Note that most of these methods are commands: if they produce data that should be sent over the socket, they will give this to you by emitting `data` events on the `driver.io` stream.  #### `driver.on('open', function(event) {})`  Adds a callback to execute when the socket becomes open.  #### `driver.on('message', function(event) {})`  Adds a callback to execute when a message is received. `event` will have a `data` attribute containing either a string in the case of a text message or a `Buffer` in the case of a binary message.  You can also listen for messages using the `driver.messages.on('data')` event, which emits strings for text messages and buffers for binary messages.  #### `driver.on('error', function(event) {})`  Adds a callback to execute when a protocol error occurs due to the other peer sending an invalid byte sequence. `event` will have a `message` attribute describing the error.  #### `driver.on('close', function(event) {})`  Adds a callback to execute when the socket becomes closed. The `event` object has `code` and `reason` attributes.  #### `driver.addExtension(extension)`  Registers a protocol extension whose operation will be negotiated via the `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header. `extension` is any extension compatible with the [websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node) framework.  #### `driver.setHeader(name, value)`  Sets a custom header to be sent as part of the handshake response, either from the server or from the client. Must be called before `start()`, since this is when the headers are serialized and sent.  #### `driver.start()`  Initiates the protocol by sending the handshake - either the response for a server-side driver or the request for a client-side one. This should be the first method you invoke.  Returns `true` if and only if a handshake was sent.  #### `driver.parse(string)`  Takes a string and parses it, potentially resulting in message events being emitted (see `on('message')` above) or in data being sent to `driver.io`.  You should send all data you receive via I/O to this method by piping a stream into `driver.io`.  #### `driver.text(string)`  Sends a text message over the socket. If the socket handshake is not yet complete, the message will be queued until it is. Returns `true` if the message was sent or queued, and `false` if the socket can no longer send messages.  This method is equivalent to `driver.messages.write(string)`.  #### `driver.binary(buffer)`  Takes a `Buffer` and sends it as a binary message. Will queue and return `true` or `false` the same way as the `text` method. It will also return `false` if the driver does not support binary messages.  This method is equivalent to `driver.messages.write(buffer)`.  #### `driver.ping(string = '', function() {})`  Sends a ping frame over the socket, queueing it if necessary. `string` and the callback are both optional. If a callback is given, it will be invoked when the socket receives a pong frame whose content matches `string`. Returns `false` if frames can no longer be sent, or if the driver does not support ping/pong.  #### `driver.pong(string = '')`  Sends a pong frame over the socket, queueing it if necessary. `string` is optional. Returns `false` if frames can no longer be sent, or if the driver does not support ping/pong.  You don't need to call this when a ping frame is received;" pings are replied to automatically by the driver. This method is for sending unsolicited pongs.  #### `driver.close()`  Initiates the closing handshake if the socket is still open. For drivers with no closing handshake, this will result in the immediate execution of the `on('close')` driver. For drivers with a closing handshake, this sends a closing frame and `emit('close')` will execute when a response is received or a protocol error occurs.  #### `driver.version`  Returns the WebSocket version in use as a string. Will either be `hixie-75`, `hixie-76` or `hybi-$version`.  #### `driver.protocol`  Returns a string containing the selected subprotocol, if any was agreed upon using the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` mechanism. This value becomes available after `emit('open')` has fired.   ## License  (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2010-2016 James Coglan  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images, audiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example), and so this license only governs the rights over the Database, and not the contents of the Database individually. Licensors may therefore wish to use this license together with another license for the contents.  Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be covered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts, trademark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights over information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may have to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing activities not covered by this License.  ------  The Licensor (as defined below)   and   You (as defined below)   agree as follows:   ### 1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words  'Collective Database' - Means this Database in unmodified form as part of a collection of independent databases in themselves that together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Database will not be considered a Derivative Database.  'Convey' - As a verb, means Using the Database, a Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database in any way that enables a Person to make or receive copies of the Database or a Derivative Database.  Conveying does not include interaction with a user through a computer network, or creating and Using a Produced Work, where no transfer of a copy of the Database or a Derivative Database occurs.  'Contents' - The contents of this Database, which includes the information, independent works, or other material collected into the Database. For example, the contents of the Database could be factual data or works such as images, audiovisual material, text, or sounds.  'Database' - A collection of material (the Contents) arranged in a systematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic or other means offered under the terms of this License.  'Database Directive' - Means Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended or succeeded.  'Database Right' - Means rights resulting from the Chapter III ('sui generis') rights in the Database Directive (as amended and as transposed by member states), which includes the Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, as well as any similar rights available in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4.   'Derivative Database' - Means a database based upon the Database, and includes any translation, adaptation, arrangement, modification, or any other alteration of the Database or of a Substantial part of the Contents. This includes, but is not limited to, Extracting or Re-utilising the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents in a new Database.  'Extraction' - Means the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a Substantial part of the Contents to another medium by any means or in any form.  'License' - Means this license agreement and is both a license of rights such as copyright and Database Rights and an agreement in contract.  'Licensor' - Means the Person that offers the Database under the terms of this License.   'Person' - Means a natural or legal person or a body of persons corporate or incorporate.  'Produced Work' -  a work (such as an image, audiovisual material, text, or sounds) resulting from using the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents (via a search or other query) from this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as part of a Collective Database.    'Publicly' - means to Persons other than You or under Your control by either more than 50% ownership or by the power to direct their activities (such as contracting with an independent consultant).   'Re-utilisation' - means any form of making available to the public all or a Substantial part of the Contents by the distribution of copies, by renting, by online or other forms of transmission.  'Substantial' - Means substantial in terms of quantity or quality or a combination of both. The repeated and systematic Extraction or Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may amount to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the Contents.  'Use' - As a verb, means doing any act that is restricted by copyright or Database Rights whether in the original medium or any other;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
