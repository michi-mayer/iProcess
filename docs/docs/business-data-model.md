> You can also find the data model in [Volkswagen's Confluence][confluence].

## How to update it

You can edit the business data model using [draw.io][drawio], either via the desktop app or the web client.
Then, open the source file (`iProcess/docs/docs/assets/business-data-model.svg`), which is in SVG format.

Once you have finished updating the data model, save it and export it as an SVG in 
`iProcess/docs/docs/assets/business-data-model.svg`. You will need to push this file to the `iProcess` source 
repository by creating a new branch named `feat/update-business-data-model`, and then create a PR to the main branch - 
if you don't know how to do it, please ask to a _developer_ teammate.
